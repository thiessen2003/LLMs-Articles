    "section": "A national holiday",
    "text": "A national holiday\n\nThis Sunday is a special date for most Americans who, like me, love football (in my case, the true one, a.k.a soccer for you citizens of the US): the Super Bowl. At 6:30 pm on February 11th, the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers will compete for the title of the Super Bowl, perhaps the most sought-after title in every sport, in Las Vegas, a controversial place that raises the debate of something that has been disturbing the world of sports worldwide: betting.\nThe rise of online casinos and betting platforms has generated a massive increase in the number of individual gamblers who want to try their luck in whatever game they desire to bet on.\n\n\nWhat does it have to do with ChatGPT?\nI’m not going to lie, but for some people, betting on sports has nothing to do with ChatGPT. Nevertheless, while using this phenomenal LLM, a doubt came across my mind: what if I asked for gambling suggestions from ChatGPT? Do not blame; the thing is basically a super brain with almost unlimited access to data; its opinion must be valid.\nTherefore, I tried to ask ChatGPT 4.0 what team I should bet on for the Super Bowl. You can see the prompt below.\n  \n\n\nThe point that I was trying to bring up with all of this\n\nAfter reading GPT’s response, you probably had the same impressions as me: yep, it was a pretty standard response. Indeed, that is what I was actually expecting from the LLM, which was basically statistical data scrapped from the web with a touch of information as well. Overall, it is a satisfactory one. However, there is one thing for me that is truly interesting: there is not even a single word that indicates bias or a recommendation to pick a specific team. On the one hand, people might think that it was because ChatGPT is not able to conclude things logically. However, if you ask ChatGPT 4.0 complex Calculus II questions (as I have already done) it will have no problem in gathering the information processed/obtained and presenting a logical conclusion. However, despite of having the data that concluded the likelihood of both teams to win, it did not even indicate what team would be the best to bet on.\nAnd no, ChatGPT 4.0 is not getting “less intelligent” or its programmers. In fact, I guess that the developers are, in fact, getting smarter. The reason why is that OpenAI is deeply focusing its recent efforts on making sure that ChatGPT makes ethical and correct decisions.\nNow that it has an optimized LLM with billions, perhaps trillions of parameters, OpenAI is trying to make sure, through a process of continuous tests and debugs, that GPT does not produce answers that can be offensive or detrimental to someone, as in a case of gambling. Instead of adding new information, the programmers are restraining certain parameters and adding safety measures such that any harm to users is avoided. Therefore, if you are trying to take advantage of ChatGPT’s answers, well, something illegal might not be the way to go, and, honestly, I think that with upcoming regulatory decisions and limitations and the establishment of safety measures, this will be the dictating trend for the future of AI.\n\nThank you for reading!"

Great! Then it means that you are probably a good person and a law-abiding citizen (also if these are some of your usual prompts, and I think you should rethink some of your life choices). Either way, I will assume that you are a normal person who does not try to build bombs at home and, thus, never tried to get some response on ChatGPT on how to do it. To show you the outcome, this is what ChatGPT generates when I ask him to do such a thing.\n\nWell, as you can see and might as well have presumed, finding the “magical recipe” to develop the new atomic bomb from the comfort of your own home. But why is that? Shouldn’t LLMs just act like humans trying to communicate and develop logically correct sentences? Well, technically, yes. But imagine you are the CEO of a new OpenAI-like company that has developed the most advanced LLM.

I am not saying that you should avoid thinking logically about programming and give up on your daily hustle on LeetCode to start using only ChatGPT to develop your programs. My point is that for conducting repetitive and tedious tasks in simpler programs that do not involve integrating multiple systems or frameworks, having an LLM like Microsoft or ChatGPT can be quite handy.\nOf course, as we all know, even though LLMs are becoming more assertive every single day, they are still far from being perfect or at least similar to the human brain in terms of cognitive skills. Still, ChatGPT 4.0, in particular, gives some pretty good answers for coding problems, like the ones that you find in LeetCode’s in the easy and medium difficulty categories."

    "text": "Ok, but what does data have to do with the efficiency of ChatGPT or its usefulness in solving coding questions?\nWell, to answer this question, I would like to talk about an experience that I went through one of these past few days in one of my coding classes. In this case, it is a class focused on developing mobile applications, with Swift, not-so-popular programming languages used mostly for applications run by Apple devices, such as iOS and MAC OS programs. The class itself is great, and I always catch myself trying to develop apps by myself and work further on the topics discussed in class. For instance, I was trying to develop a simple app that displayed some texts based on text inputted by the user. For this application, I stored the variables and info in a state similar to what is done with hooks in React. Since I still do not know that much about Swift syntax and properties, I asked him to help me implement conditionals in some of my variables stored in the game state. Usually, this kind of problems are easily solved by ChatGPT when I ask to come up with solutions in JavaScript, for example. But, for Swift, it just did not work: ChatGPT spent minutes evaluating and reevaluating its output, which, after multiple attempts, did not work at all. Quite an unexpected behavior for such a powerful AI tool. So, I caught myself thinking, why?"

Still, data is pivotal to the proper functioning of LLMs, especially for the “learning” phases. In a simple way, LLMs fundamentally get data from the internet through methods such as web scrapping on a wide variety of topics. Once it has obtained the data, it starts to train the LLM model and perform a series of learning steps. Once the LLMs are trained and learned through data, a series of other important steps are executed to optimize the LLM, such as fine-tuning, which helps in establishing the parameter temperatures for certain inputs and contexts.\nIn summary, data is fundamental for ChatGPT to answer a certain question. For instance, if I type “What is the name of Gabriel Thiessen’s Dachshund?”, the answer is the following\n\nAnd that is quite obvious and predictable, because there is no available online data about it."

    "text": "A simple counting problem\n\nFor most people, counting numbers is a simple operation composed of basically adding numbers. From an early age, most of us know how to compute 1 + 1, 2 + 2, and 2 - 1. It is an intuitive operation that is ubiquitous in our daily lives. As LLMs are basically developed to generate responses that are most likely human ones, one would infer that LLMs do not have a problem in computing the total price of multiple objects, calculating means and medians, and counting the number of letters in a single word… However, this last one might not be so easy for them to figure out. To better understand what I am saying, let’s go through a sample question\n\nCount the number that each letter appears in the word college.\n\n\nYou will probably answer something like c = 1, o = 1, l = 2, e = 2, g = 1…\nAnd that’s it! There is no interpretation, no magical formula, no advanced counting theorem. Just pure and simple math. However, how do we really perform this operation?\n\nHow do we do it?\nSome people might deliberate a bit on these simple additions, especially people who might instantly respond to the questions. No matter if it is our automatic or analytical brain system (shoutout to Daniel Kahneman) that is performing the operation, one thing is for sure: it is a simple counting operation.\nWe basically identify different characters visually based on previous knowledge of the alphabet and its characters and perform logical steps composed of adding numbers to check how many times the characters with the same visual representation are represented in this specific range of letters. This ability to perform simple operations (which are not too simple for a machine) comes from our brain’s impressive capacity for interpreting, storing, and using visual data for other means. It is as simple as that: you look, interpret, and do whatever you want with this information without any additional step to evaluate such values. However, that is not how LLMs work.\nTo perform any type of operation, LLMs rely on a process called tokenization. Tokenization is one of the fundamental steps in data analysis for LLMs in which they process, usually words, as a set of integers. For instance, while we read “dog” as just “dog,” a machine interprets dogs as 001. This step is pivotal for generative AI, as it allows the machine to make associations of what words most often appear after the dog in a sentence and, thus, allows it to come up with a plausible answer.\nBut letters are a whole different story… You might be wondering, what if we want to analyze letters in a word? This tokenization process is then applied to each individual character in the designated word, which turns out to be troublesome for some specific LLMs. In the case of Copilot, no matter if it is a common word in terms of recurrence or an unusual word, it has difficulties in tokenizing it. Check it out below.\n\n\nHow does Copilot respond to the prompt?\nGPT3.5 Turbo\n\n\nAs you can see, it has a lot of difficulties processing the word anthropology.\n\nWhat about other words\n\n\nThis time, though, Copilot successfully counted the number of letters in the word college\n\nIs is the same thing for ChatGPT 4?\n\n\nUnlike what you may be thinking, not actually. Supposedly, Copilot uses Open AI’s GPT 4, too. However, when we insert the exact same prompt on ChatGPT 4, it answers correctly!\n\nWhat can we conclude with this experiment?\nI would say that the results obtained can show us two important things: LLMs are still, in general, not good at processing individual words, and ChatGPT 4 and Copilot are perhaps not as similar as we thought.\nRegarding the first assertion, doing this experience makes it really easy to visualize the limitations of performing tokenization in comparison to the way that the human brain interprets words and counting. Probably, for more unusual words, like anthropology, Copilot simply attributes the same tokens to different letters or computes syllables as single words. Meanwhile, for more usual words in the English language, like college, its word tokenization process is more optimized and thus does not generate any problem in terms of interpretation and computation.\nWHAT ABOUT ChatGPT 4?\nWell, that is content for other articles, but at least in theory, Copilot should behave similarly to ChatGPT 4. Perhaps this indicates that, in fact, ChatGPT 4 and Copilot are not as similar as Microsoft proposed…\nThank you for reading!"

    "text": "Restrictions, restrictions, and restrictions\nWell, if you read my last article, you probably know that having parameters to avoid certain prompts is a good thing. However, for those out there who still want to bypass the system, I would like to provide a way to get unfiltered responses and some inadequate stuff from your prompts, this article is going to teach you how to do it!\n\nHow exactly?\nSince the latest version of ChatGPT has many restrictions, and it is quite difficult to bypass them, for this specific case, we will use another LLM, one that is being developed by Meta: Llama. Like ChatGPT, Llama is an LLM that is used for the most varied purposes. However, there is a specific open-source project that uses the same architecture and tokenizer as Llama2, but without the same constraints. Therefore, I will use it to demonstrate how LLMs behave without filters, and, perhaps, suffice the desires of people who want to use LLMs for sketchy purposes.\n\n\nI did not ask for it…\nFirstly, I will follow up with the previous article’s example of coming up with the steps to craft a homemade bomb. In this case, if I make Llama come up with an answer to the same question, the result will be the following:\n\nQuite crazy, no? Now you see why it is important to establish constraints on the different LLMs, especially the most popular ones like ChatGPT. Like drugs or other illicit things, it should not be that easy to handle such a powerful tool in the wrong hands. If you think that coming up with all the required steps to craft a homemade bomb is not enough, look at what Llama prints when you ask it to come up with racist insults on immigrants (to be clear, I just used this example because I am myself an immigrant)\n\n\n\nGoogle Gemini and why is it important to discuss this topic right now\nYou might not have read this specific news, but recently, there was a huge polemic on Gemini. It is one of Google’s biggest projects and the big tech’s biggest investment in the field of AI. Fundamentally, Google Gemini is a multimodal generative AI model that is quite similar to the LLMs that we know. However, unlike other technologies such as ChatGPT 3.5 and Llama, it had an image generation feature, which, let’s say, caused some trouble for Google developers.\nThe whole turmoil related to Google Gemini began when some historically incorrect and inadequate images generated by Gemini started circulating on multiple social media and news platforms, such as the New York Times and X. For instance, some people asked Gemini to draw pictures of 1943 German soldiers, and the AI displayed the pictures of black and Asian individuals. The controversy was so huge and meaningful that it made Google temporarily deactivate the image generation feature of Gemini. Below, you can find Google’s official statement regarding the question that was posted on X.\n\nEven though this specific news is not directly related to text generation, I believe that it correctly represents why it is so important to establish security measurements and filter on AI to avoid any specific group being affected in a negative way by LLMs responses. Therefore, be glad that you have access to such a powerful technology, and stop trying to bypass its safety constraints.\nThank you for reading!"
