    "## Internships, internships, internships...\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are a college student like me, I am pretty sure that you are, most of the times (unless you already have an offer) super worried about internships. Usually, you apply to me and never hear back from most, it takes forever to get a response, salaries are not always that great, there are a zillion other people applying to the same position, and, above all, if you get through the first stages of an internship application process, you still have to do interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this blog post, let's leave technical interviews aside and focus on behavioral interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What could go wrong if I just need to talk about myself?\" A LOT OF THINGS! Behavioral interviews are often way more complicated than they usually seem. Even though you do not have to live code or come up with a marvellous ideas to compute the amount of chocolate cookies that teenagers eat during summer in Idaho for a product management position, it is not easy to synthetize professional, academic, and personal information about you in a good and practical way for an interviewer while being stressed out. Even though there is no magical recipe, I is always good to have a guide or at least a script for you to practice or follow when doing such as interviewing, so that you can avoid talking a bunch of non-sense stuff when asked \"Tell me more about yourself?\" or \"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to (at least try) to help everyone that wants to have a successful interview and conquer every opportunities for the next summer, I decided to use ChatGPT 4.0 to come up with what are according to him the most adequate answers to some of the most common interview questions out there. Also, so that ChatGPT 4.0 can be more precise, I provided him with the following contexts to answer the respective questions\n",
