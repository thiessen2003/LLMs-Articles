# LLMs-Articles

### Project Overview
This repository documents explorations into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on prompt engineering, model experimentation, and practical applications of LLMs. These experiments include various techniques used to optimize model performance in generating human-like text responses.

### Key Features
- **Prompt Engineering**: Explorations on how to craft effective prompts for different tasks.
- **Model Experimentation**: Testing various LLMs like GPT and RoBERTa for diverse use cases.
- **Use Cases**: Practical applications and blog-style documentation of model usage.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Hugging Face Transformers**
- **OpenAI GPT API**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**

### Running Locally
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run Jupyter Notebooks to explore experiments.
