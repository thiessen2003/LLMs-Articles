    "section": "A national holiday",
    "text": "A national holiday\n\nThis Sunday is a special date for most Americans who, like me, love football (in my case, the true one, a.k.a soccer for you citizens of the US): the Super Bowl. At 6:30 pm on February 11th, the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers will compete for the title of the Super Bowl, perhaps the most sought-after title in every sport, in Las Vegas, a controversial place that raises the debate of something that has been disturbing the world of sports worldwide: betting.\nThe rise of online casinos and betting platforms has generated a massive increase in the number of individual gamblers who want to try their luck in whatever game they desire to bet on.\n\n\nWhat does it have to do with ChatGPT?\nI’m not going to lie, but for some people, betting on sports has nothing to do with ChatGPT. Nevertheless, while using this phenomenal LLM, a doubt came across my mind: what if I asked for gambling suggestions from ChatGPT? Do not blame; the thing is basically a super brain with almost unlimited access to data; its opinion must be valid.\nTherefore, I tried to ask ChatGPT 4.0 what team I should bet on for the Super Bowl. You can see the prompt below.\n  \n\n\nThe point that I was trying to bring up with all of this\n\nAfter reading GPT’s response, you probably had the same impressions as me: yep, it was a pretty standard response. Indeed, that is what I was actually expecting from the LLM, which was basically statistical data scrapped from the web with a touch of information as well. Overall, it is a satisfactory one. However, there is one thing for me that is truly interesting: there is not even a single word that indicates bias or a recommendation to pick a specific team. On the one hand, people might think that it was because ChatGPT is not able to conclude things logically. However, if you ask ChatGPT 4.0 complex Calculus II questions (as I have already done) it will have no problem in gathering the information processed/obtained and presenting a logical conclusion. However, despite of having the data that concluded the likelihood of both teams to win, it did not even indicate what team would be the best to bet on.\nAnd no, ChatGPT 4.0 is not getting “less intelligent” or its programmers. In fact, I guess that the developers are, in fact, getting smarter. The reason why is that OpenAI is deeply focusing its recent efforts on making sure that ChatGPT makes ethical and correct decisions.\nNow that it has an optimized LLM with billions, perhaps trillions of parameters, OpenAI is trying to make sure, through a process of continuous tests and debugs, that GPT does not produce answers that can be offensive or detrimental to someone, as in a case of gambling. Instead of adding new information, the programmers are restraining certain parameters and adding safety measures such that any harm to users is avoided. Therefore, if you are trying to take advantage of ChatGPT’s answers, well, something illegal might not be the way to go, and, honestly, I think that with upcoming regulatory decisions and limitations and the establishment of safety measures, this will be the dictating trend for the future of AI.\n\nThank you for reading!"

    "title": "1 + 1 = 2 … perhaps not for Microsoft Copilot",
    "section": "A simple counting problem",
    "text": "A simple counting problem\n\nFor most people, counting numbers is a simple operation composed of basically adding numbers. From an early age, most of us know how to compute 1 + 1, 2 + 2, and 2 - 1. It is an intuitive operation that is ubiquitous in our daily lives. As LLMs are basically developed to generate responses that are most likely human ones, one would infer that LLMs do not have a problem in computing the total price of multiple objects, calculating means and medians, and counting the number of letters in a single word… However, this last one might not be so easy for them to figure out. To better understand what I am saying, let’s go through a sample question\n\nCount the number that each letter appears in the word college.\n\n\nYou will probably answer something like c = 1, o = 1, l = 2, e = 2, g = 1…\nAnd that’s it! There is no interpretation, no magical formula, no advanced counting theorem. Just pure and simple math. However, how do we really perform this operation?\n\nHow do we do it?\nSome people might deliberate a bit on these simple additions, especially people who might instantly respond to the questions. No matter if it is our automatic or analytical brain system (shoutout to Daniel Kahneman) that is performing the operation, one thing is for sure: it is a simple counting operation.\nWe basically identify different characters visually based on previous knowledge of the alphabet and its characters and perform logical steps composed of adding numbers to check how many times the characters with the same visual representation are represented in this specific range of letters. This ability to perform simple operations (which are not too simple for a machine) comes from our brain’s impressive capacity for interpreting, storing, and using visual data for other means. It is as simple as that: you look, interpret, and do whatever you want with this information without any additional step to evaluate such values. However, that is not how LLMs work.\nTo perform any type of operation, LLMs rely on a process called tokenization. Tokenization is one of the fundamental steps in data analysis for LLMs in which they process, usually words, as a set of integers. For instance, while we read “dog” as just “dog,” a machine interprets dogs as 001. This step is pivotal for generative AI, as it allows the machine to make associations of what words most often appear after the dog in a sentence and, thus, allows it to come up with a plausible answer.\nBut letters are a whole different story… You might be wondering, what if we want to analyze letters in a word? This tokenization process is then applied to each individual character in the designated word, which turns out to be troublesome for some specific LLMs. In the case of Copilot, no matter if it is a common word in terms of recurrence or an unusual word, it has difficulties in tokenizing it. Check it out below.\n\n\nHow does Copilot respond to the prompt?\nGPT3.5 Turbo\n\n\nAs you can see, it has a lot of difficulties processing the word anthropology.\n\nWhat about other words\n\n\nThis time, though, Copilot successfully counted the number of letters in the word college\n\nIs is the same thing for ChatGPT 4?\n\n\nUnlike what you may be thinking, not actually. Supposedly, Copilot uses Open AI’s GPT 4, too. However, when we insert the exact same prompt on ChatGPT 4, it answers correctly!\n\nWhat can we conclude with this experiment?\nI would say that the results obtained can show us two important things: LLMs are still, in general, not good at processing individual words, and ChatGPT 4 and Copilot are perhaps not as similar as we thought.\nRegarding the first assertion, doing this experience makes it really easy to visualize the limitations of performing tokenization in comparison to the way that the human brain interprets words and counting. Probably, for more unusual words, like anthropology, Copilot simply attributes the same tokens to different letters or computes syllables as single words. Meanwhile, for more usual words in the English language, like college, its word tokenization process is more optimized and thus does not generate any problem in terms of interpretation and computation.\nWHAT ABOUT ChatGPT 4?\nWell, that is content for other articles, but at least in theory, Copilot should behave similarly to ChatGPT 4. Perhaps this indicates that, in fact, ChatGPT 4 and Copilot are not as similar as Microsoft proposed…\nThank you for reading!"
