    "text": "For most people, counting numbers is a simple operation composed of basically adding numbers. From an early age, most of us know how to compute 1 + 1, 2 + 2, and 2 - 1. It is an intuitive operation that is ubiquitous in our daily lives. As LLMs are basically developed to generate responses that are most likely human ones, one would infer that LLMs do not have a problem in computing the total price of multiple objects, calculating means and medians, and counting the number of letters in a single word… However, this last one might not be so easy for them to figure out. To better understand what I am saying, let’s go through a sample question\n\nCount the number that each letter appears in the word college.\n\n\nYou will probably answer something like c = 1, o = 1, l = 2, e = 2, g = 1…\nAnd that’s it! There is no interpretation, no magical formula, no advanced counting theorem. Just pure and simple math. However, how do we really perform this operation?\n\n\nSome people might deliberate a bit on these simple additions, especially people who might instantly respond to the questions. No matter if it is our automatic or analytical brain system (shoutout to Daniel Kahneman) that is performing the operation, one thing is for sure: it is a simple counting operation.\nWe basically identify different characters visually based on previous knowledge of the alphabet and its characters and perform logical steps composed of adding numbers to check how many times the characters with the same visual representation are represented in this specific range of letters. This ability to perform simple operations (which are not too simple for a machine) comes from our brain’s impressive capacity for interpreting, storing, and using visual data for other means. It is as simple as that: you look, interpret, and do whatever you want with this information without any additional step to evaluate such values. However, that is not how LLMs work.\nTo perform any type of operation, LLMs rely on a process called tokenization. Tokenization is one of the fundamental steps in data analysis for LLMs in which they process, usually words, as a set of integers. For instance, while we read “dog” as just “dog,” a machine interprets dogs as 001. This step is pivotal for generative AI, as it allows the machine to make associations of what words most often appear after the dog in a sentence and, thus, allows it to come up with a plausible answer.\nBut letters are a whole different story… You might be wondering, what if we want to analyze letters in a word? This tokenization process is then applied to each individual character in the designated word, which turns out to be troublesome for some specific LLMs. In the case of Copilot, no matter if it is a common word in terms of recurrence or an unusual word, it has difficulties in tokenizing it. Check it out below.\n\n\n\nGPT3.5 Turbo\n\n\nAs you can see, it has a lot of difficulties processing the word anthropology.\n\nWhat about other words\n\n\nThis time, though, Copilot successfully counted the number of letters in the word college\n\nIs is the same thing for ChatGPT 4?\n\n\nUnlike what you may be thinking, not actually. Supposedly, Copilot uses Open AI’s GPT 4, too. However, when we insert the exact same prompt on ChatGPT 4, it answers correctly!\n\nWhat can we conclude with this experiment?\nI would say that the results obtained can show us two important things: LLMs are still, in general, not good at processing individual words, and ChatGPT 4 and Copilot are perhaps not as similar as we thought.\nRegarding the first assertion, doing this experience makes it really easy to visualize the limitations of performing tokenization in comparison to the way that the human brain interprets words and counting. Probably, for more unusual words, like anthropology, Copilot simply attributes the same tokens to different letters or computes syllables as single words. Meanwhile, for more usual words in the English language, like college, its word tokenization process is more optimized and thus does not generate any problem in terms of interpretation and computation.\nWHAT ABOUT ChatGPT 4?\nWell, that is content for other articles, but at least in theory, Copilot should behave similarly to ChatGPT 4. Perhaps this indicates that, in fact, ChatGPT 4 and Copilot are not as similar as Microsoft proposed…\nThank you for reading!"

    "text": "How do LLMs and their answers change with time?\nDuring one of my COMM 4190 class’ in-class activities, I came across a situation that raised this doubt in my head. The activity in particular was focused on making the LLM of your choice come up with an idea for a product, as well as its name and descritpion. Initially, I used ChatGPT 4 to provide me with some ideas of businesses that would be interesting and attractive for customers.\n\nThis is what ChatGPT 4 generated\n\n\nEco-Friendly Packaging Solutions: Develop a range of biodegradable and compostable packaging products for businesses in the food, beverage, and retail sectors, aiming to reduce plastic waste and carbon footprint.\n\n\nTelehealth Services for Mental Health: Create an online platform that provides accessible, affordable, and confidential mental health services, including therapy sessions, mental wellness tools, and community support, especially targeting remote areas with limited access to such services.\n\n\nSmart Home Integration Systems: Develop a comprehensive smart home system that seamlessly integrates various smart devices and appliances, offering enhanced convenience, energy efficiency, and security through a single, user-friendly interface.\n\n\nSubscription-Based Meal Prep Kits for Special Diets: Offer a subscription service that delivers weekly meal prep kits catering to specific dietary needs such as vegan, keto, gluten-free, etc., focusing on healthy, organic ingredients and sustainable packaging.\n\n\nAI-Powered Educational Tools for Personalized Learning: Create an AI-driven platform that offers personalized learning experiences for students, adapting to their learning pace, style, and interests, and providing real-time feedback to enhance their educational journey.\n\n\nVirtual Reality Experiences for Remote Tourism: Develop virtual reality packages that allow users to experience travel and cultural tours from the comfort of their homes, targeting travel enthusiasts unable to travel due to health, financial, or other constraints.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Solutions for Small Businesses: Offer consultancy and implementation services for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to transition to renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, and biomass, reducing their energy costs and environmental impact.\n\n\nWearable Health Monitoring Devices: Design and manufacture wearable devices that monitor vital health metrics in real-time, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and glucose levels, catering to individuals with chronic conditions or those seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle.\n\n\nBlockchain-Based Supply Chain Management Platform: Create a blockchain platform that enhances transparency, efficiency, and security in supply chains, allowing businesses to track products from origin to consumer, reducing fraud, and ensuring ethical practices.\n\n\nSustainable Urban Farming Solutions: Develop innovative urban farming solutions, such as vertical farms or hydroponic systems, that enable city dwellers to grow fresh produce efficiently, promoting local food production and sustainability.\n\n\nSome nice business ideas, right? Now, this is what GPT 3.5 generated\n\n\nVirtual Event Management Platform: Develop a comprehensive platform that enables businesses and organizations to plan, manage, and host virtual events such as conferences, trade shows, and webinars. Offer features like customizable event spaces, attendee engagement tools, and analytics.\n\n\nEco-Friendly Packaging Solutions: Create a company that specializes in producing sustainable and biodegradable packaging materials for businesses looking to reduce their environmental footprint. Offer customizable solutions for various industries, including food and beverage, cosmetics, and e-commerce.\n\n\nRemote Work Productivity Tools: Develop software tools designed to enhance productivity and collaboration for remote teams. This could include project management platforms, communication tools, and virtual team-building solutions tailored to the needs of distributed workforces.\n\n\nPersonalized Health and Wellness Plans: Launch a service that provides personalized health and wellness plans based on individual needs, preferences, and goals. Offer features such as virtual consultations with nutritionists, fitness trainers, and wellness coaches, along with customized meal plans and exercise routines.\n\n\nRenewable Energy Consultancy: Start a consultancy firm specializing in renewable energy solutions for businesses and organizations seeking to transition to sustainable energy sources. Provide services such as energy audits, feasibility studies, and implementation strategies for solar, wind, and other renewable energy technologies.\n\n\nTech-Empowered Elderly Care Services: Create a business that leverages technology to provide innovative elderly care services, such as remote health monitoring systems, medication management apps, and virtual caregiver support networks. Focus on improving quality of life and promoting independence for seniors.\n\n\nSubscription Box for Sustainable Living: Curate and deliver subscription boxes filled with eco-friendly products and sustainable lifestyle items, such as organic skincare products, reusable household goods, and ethically sourced clothing. Offer monthly or quarterly subscription plans with customizable options.\n\n\nOnline Learning Platform for Skilled Trades: Develop an online learning platform that offers courses and certification programs for skilled trades such as plumbing, electrical work, carpentry, and HVAC repair.

Utilize technology such as augmented reality (AR) to allow clients to visualize design concepts in their own spaces.\n\n\nOk, so what?\nOn a first look, it seems that both the answers are fundamentally the same. However, there is one specific subtlety that makes this whole comparison really interesting. If you take a closer look, it is possible to see that ChatGPT 3.5 mentions on some of his answers business ideas that are related to the use of virtual reality. However, there is no reference to AI-related businesses. Meanwhile, ChatGPT 4.0 included as some of its business ideas AI-Powered Educational Tools for Personalized Learning. Even though it is a minor change, I truly believe that this is a really interesting way to analyze how updates on ChatGPT parameters reflects on their answers.\n\n\nRecent updates\nTo clarify my point, it is worth mentioning that the last update on ChatGPT 3.5 happened in January 2022 (reported by the AI tool itself). However, ChatGPT 4.0 includes data up to April 2023. Back in January 2022, AI was not a big topic when it came to business ideas, as we werer still focusing on the Metaverse and blockchain. In between these two dates though, we witnessed and abnormal grow in the use and popularity of AI tools for the most varied topics, ranging from education to business. Therefor , it is anturally reflected on the answers that this LLM provides. Pretty cool, right?\nThank you for reading!"
